questions:
  - question: 'Did you need to do an ICO to launch?'
    answer: 'At the Lonero Association we believe Initial Coin Offerings aren't always necessary for driving innovation to the blockchain industry. Blockchain projects should not be profiting until their technology has been developed. We will be developing and releasing Lonero into the market with NO ICO.'

  - question: 'What is special about a decentralized internet?'
    answer: 'Technology needs to be put back into the hands of the people. The modern day internet is prune to censorship and centralization, while requiring a lot of outdated grid technology and telecom towers to work. We need to change that.'

  - question: 'Can cryptocurrency be used by criminals or for harmful activities?'
    answer: 'Any asset, including fiat forms of currency can be misused. Somebody can go attack somebody with a spoon, doesn't make all spoons bad. The unfortunate side of technology, espcially tech that is good, is that someone out there will use something for its unintended use.'
